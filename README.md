# Sudoku Board Validator and Solver  

The **Sudoku Board Validator and Solver** is a Java-based application designed to validate and solve Sudoku puzzles. It features a user-friendly graphical interface and a robust backend for efficient puzzle solving.  

Using a recursive backtracking algorithm, the solver handles even complex puzzles while ensuring the input configuration is valid. This project combines algorithmic precision with an intuitive design for an engaging user experience.

## **Project Overview**  
The Sudoku Solver allows users to:  
- Enter a custom Sudoku puzzle using an interactive grid.  
- Validate whether the puzzle configuration is valid.  
- Solve the puzzle using the **backtracking algorithm**.  
- Clear the board to start fresh.  

## **Features**  
- **Interactive GUI:** Built with Java Swing, the interface is sleek, responsive, and user-friendly.  
- **Real-Time Validation:** Checks the correctness of puzzle inputs instantly.  
- **Efficient Algorithm:** Implements the backtracking technique to solve puzzles accurately and quickly.  
- **Custom Design:** Includes aesthetic elements like rounded buttons, gridlines, and bi-tone color themes for a polished look.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Java:** Core logic and application development.  
- **Swing:** GUI design and user interaction.  
- **Backtracking Algorithm:** For solving puzzles programmatically.
